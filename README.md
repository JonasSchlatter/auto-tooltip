# Auto-Tooltip

This demo showcases server side code extension based on a dictionary file.

`<h1>` elements are given an anchor (above them, to fit the fixed menu bar).
Elements within `<strong>`-tags and bracket pairs are extended with a tooltip.

The content to be parsed is added with the article.php. The dictionary in
which to look up the tooltips (and headline anchors) is located in dict.php.
